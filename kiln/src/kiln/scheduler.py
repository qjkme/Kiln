"""Job scheduler — dispatches queued jobs to available printers.

The scheduler runs in a background thread, periodically checking for:
1. Queued jobs that need to be dispatched
2. Idle printers that can accept work
3. Running jobs that need progress monitoring

It bridges the gap between the job queue (where agents submit work)
